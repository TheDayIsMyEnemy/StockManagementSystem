# StockManagementSystem

The current Front-end implementation does not show any message to the user when there is an error or invalid request. It also uses Sqlite for simplicity. There aren't any unit tests too

## How to run it

Clone the repository and then execute the following command inside the root folder

```bash
dotnet run --project ./src/StockManagementSystem.csproj
```

Navigate to: https://localhost:7291/
